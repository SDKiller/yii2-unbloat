Post-create & post-update cleanup for Yii2-Composer project
===========================================================

This is a 'post-create-project-cmd' & 'post-update-cmd' composer script to cleanup Yii2 project of not nesessary files.
Composer (unlike Bower) has no 'ignore' section in composer.json - so you install files not always nesessary in production (like `docs`, `tests`, etc.).

```
composer.phar require --prefer-dist zyx/yii2-unbloat "*"
```
