Warning! This project is not maintained any more!
=================================================

As similar functionality was [introduced](https://github.com/francoispluchino/composer-asset-plugin/issues/40) by [Fran√ßois Pluchino](https://github.com/francoispluchino) in his excellent [Composer Asset Plugin](https://github.com/francoispluchino/composer-asset-plugin), I think I should not 'reinvent the wheel' any more.

For usage of Composer Asset Plugin for that purpose [see its docs](https://github.com/francoispluchino/composer-asset-plugin/blob/master/Resources/doc/index.md#use-the-ignore-files-manager-in-the-composer-scripts).

This repository is left only for the purpose to keep BC for several private projects and will be dropped in future.


Post-update cleanup for Yii2-Composer project
---------------------------------------------

Have you suffered from tons of not nesessary for you in production files (like `docs`, `tests`, etc.) installed by Composer with almost every package?
Unfortunately Composer has no 'ignore' section in `composer.json` (unlike Bower in `bower.json`) to exclude some files and folders.

This is a `post-update-cmd` composer script to cleanup Yii2 project of not nesessary files.



Installation
------------

```
composer.phar require --prefer-dist zyx/yii2-unbloat "*"
```

TBD


Usage
-----

TBD

Add the following to `composer.json` file in your project root:


```
    ...
    "scripts": {
        ...
        "post-update-cmd": [
            "zyx\\unbloat\\Helper::postCmd"
        ]
        ...
    },
    "extra": {
        ...
        "ignore": {
            "twbs/bootstrap": "type::bower",
            "swiftmailer/swiftmailer": [
                "/.*",
                "phpunit.xml.dist",
                "doc",

            ]
        }

    }
    ...
```
